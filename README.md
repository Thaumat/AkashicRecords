# Akashic Records

## Overview

**Akashic Records provides visualization tools to explore differences in the degree and level of Character Bias in Narratives present in the articles covering common events over a collection of Popular Online Newspapers.**

## Background

**Akashic Records details the amount of Mood, and Semantic Framing of Key Entities in the continual coverage of Developing News Events. Defining Presentation Bias of Characters in a Narrative as consistent deviation in the Framing of Key Entities from their average degree of Framing in Narratives of similar News Events published by other Online Newspapers.**

## Problem

**The vast network of individuals connected through the Internet has expanded beyond the understanding of any one organization or encyclopedic tool. The combination of a wide variety of opinions and textual content produces patterns and sociological phenomena which have substantial implications for the study of biases and human interaction. This project seeks to move toward an understanding and reconstruction of these relationships as well as their impact on modern social constructs.**

## Name

**The Akashic Records are a mythical corpus of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions and intent ever to have occurred, believed to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence. While it's original believed location was the etheric plane, a similar set of records can be stored on cloud platforms over the internet, made up of articles detailing news events as covered by journalists habits of mood, and semantic framing.**

## Approach

**Bias can be defined both from the perspective of viewer opinion, as well as repeated processes of the creators of media. Bias is subjective fundamentally. What isn't subjective is the truth of a political claim, or the validity of an agrument which is made up of a set of largely true statements which through validity and coherence build the case for the truth of the arugement containing them. This I think is only part of what can make up Bias. Fake news is real news to those who share
  fundamental axioms of expressed repeated over their life and have been used to justify the validty of higher arguments requiring the truth of these fundamental axioms. For example its hard to convince a person not to throw someone in jail for saying something you don't like when they hold the axiom of "speech is can physically harm me like in the similar way to other crime". Different axioms of the truth making up higher core beliefs between others is a difficult issue to solve because
  of failure to understand the full perspective of another and how that could lead them to hold beliefs. It's can be harder to empathize with the unrelatable. I believe the blame for this rests at least partially on partially to news media, this is because according to the

**Frames contains coherent Mood, and Semantic Components containing common a common set of Entities described in a similar Mood across one or more sentences.**

    * Semantic Components are Entities and Keywords in the form of Subject -> Verb -> Object (SVO) triples.
        * Entities and Keywords can represent part or all of the Subject or Object of an SVO triple.

This project utilizes the IBM Watson API which provides sentence-level sentiment analysis, tone analysis, and the deconstruction of statements into more digestible topic units. We look at various frames created by digital entities and compare the sentiment across a selection of events and topical figures.

## Fundamental Questions
* Does an entity's background knowledge influence their interpretation of a frame?
* How do entity artifacts impact the global interpretation of frames?

## Hypotheses of Emotion Detection
    * The more imaginative, open to change, or emotionally aware a tweet seemed, the more likely it was to be liked.

    * The more organized, thoughtful, or thorough a tweet seemed, the more likely it was to be retweeted.

    * The angrier, stressed, or impulsive a tweet seemed, the less likely it was to be retweeted.

# Definitions

## Frame
A frame is a system of components related in such a way that in order to understand any one component, one must understand all components in the system. This applies particularly well to textual documents on the internet which interrelated through analyzing the same event or set of topics with a particular mindset or set of values.

* Frames are made up of a coherent set of component subject -> verb -> objects (SVO's).
* Elements are inside of components which are within sentences. A sentence can be made up of one or more components.

          * Entities
              * Extracts people, companies, organizations, cities, geographic features, and other entities from your content, and optionally detects the sentiment of each entity.
          * Keywords
              * Determines important keywords in the text, ranks them by relevance, and optionally detects the sentiment of each keyword.
          * Concepts
              * Identifies general concepts that aren’t necessarily directly referenced in the text. For example, analysis of an article about BMW, Audi, and Porsche is likely to return the "Automotive industry” concept.
      * Mood
        * Tone
            * Emotion
                * Joy, Happy, Satisfied
